Study 2.

Procedure and design:

We used an experimental design including one two-level between-subjects variable. First, participants were assigned at random to either a homogeneous instruction condition or a heterogeneous instruction condition. In both conditions, similarly to Study 1, they were presented with a red square every 1.25 second for .75 second in ten 12 displays-long series. Thus, each subject was supposed to generate 10 sequences of 12 elements. In the homogeneous condition, in all series, participants were asked to imagine tossing of a fair coin and report the result whenever they saw the red square. In the heterogeneous condition, their task altered every second series. In the odd series, they were asked to imagine the tossing of a fair coin and report the result whenever they see the red square. In the even series, participants were asked to imagine a stock market chart and to assume that price fluctuations are generated by a random process. They were instructed to try to predict whether a price will go up or down in the next time step and to report the outcome every time they see the red square. After completing the procedure of generating random series participants in both conditions were asked to fill in the Polish version of the Need for Cognition Scale. 

Raw data:

The raw data set has a bit strange structure. Although each participant was assigned only to one condition in the data set everyone has columns for responses in both conditions. That is because for each subject half of them is empty. Below, you will find a list of the variables in the original data set.

survey_finish_time -- survey completion time in seconds.

Age - age categories. 
    1 - 15-17; 
    2 - 18-24; 
    3 - 25-34; 
    4 - 35-44; 
    5 - 45-54; 
    6 - above 55.

Year - exact age in years.

Sex -- gender of the participants.
    1 - female;
    2 - male.

Condition -- Experimental condition.
    1 - homogeneous;
    2 - heterogeneous.

City_size -- the place of living. 
    1 - a village; 
    2 - a small town up to 20 thousand people; 
    3 - a small city between 20 and 90 thousand people;
    4 - a big city between 100 and 490 thousand people; 
    5 - a huge city above 500 thousand people.

Education_level -- the answer to the question: ''What was the last level of education you graduated?'' 
    1 - podstawowe / gimnazjum; 
    2 - zasadnicze; 
    3 - średnie; 
    4 - pomaturalne / policealne; 
    5 - licencjat; 
    6 - ukończone studia wyższe.

war1_1_h1_ro1 : war1_1_h1_ro12 -- responses (either 0 or 1) to the experimental task in homogenous condition. For participants who were assigned to the heterogeneous condition, these columns are empty. 

war2rm1_h1_ro1 : war2rm5_h1_ro12 -- responses (either 0 or 1) to the tossing a fair coin task in the heterogeneous condition (either 0 or 1). For participants who were assigned to the homogeneous condition, these columns are empty. 

war2g1_h1_ro1 : war2g5_h1_ro12 -- responses (either 0 or 1) to the stock market task in the heterogeneous condition. For participants who were assigned to the homogeneous condition, these columns are empty. 

v2_r1 : v2_r36 -- responses to the Polish version of the Need for Cognition Scale.
    1 - I strongly disagree 
    2 - I rather disagree
    3 - It is hard to say
    4 - I rather agree
    5 - I definitely agree

Processed data:

We used “pybdm” library from python to estimate the algorithmic complexity of the series (please read README.md for further details). For each participant, we computed the algorithmic complexity of each produced series. Therefore, each participant was represented by 10 data points ordered in a time sequence.
