    abstract = {We investigate the properties of a Block Decomposition Method (BDM), which extends the power of a Coding Theorem Method (CTM) that approximates local estimations of algorithmic complexity based on Solomonoff–Levin’s theory of algorithmic probability providing a closer connection to algorithmic complexity than previous attempts based on statistical regularities such as popular lossless compression schemes. The strategy behind BDM is to ﬁnd small computer programs that produce the components of a larger, decomposed object. The set of short computer programs can then be artfully arranged in sequence so as to produce the original object. We show that the method provides efﬁcient estimations of algorithmic complexity but that it performs like Shannon entropy when it loses accuracy. We estimate errors and study the behaviour of BDM for different boundary conditions, all of which are compared and assessed in detail. The measure may be adapted for use with more multi-dimensional objects than strings, objects such as arrays and tensors. To test the measure we demonstrate the power of CTM on low algorithmic-randomness objects that are assigned maximal entropy (e.g., π) but whose numerical approximations are closer to the theoretical low algorithmic-randomness expectation. We also test the measure on larger objects including dual, isomorphic and cospectral graphs for which we know that algorithmic randomness is low. We also release implementations of the methods in most major programming languages—Wolfram Language (Mathematica), Matlab, R, Perl, Python, Pascal, C++, and Haskell—and an online algorithmic complexity calculator.},

  abstract = {Numerous experiments have confirmed Reichenbach's (1934/1949) expectation that humans are suboptimal generators and judges of randomness--they tend to generate series with too many alter-nations (the negative recency effect) and to match the probability characteristics of the process in short subsequences (the local representativeness effect). Several classes of theories have been pro-posed to explain these results, with modest success. In the present article a stochastic model assum-ing one free parameter of serial dependence is outlined, and an experimental procedure for its test is developed. In the first experiment the model's parameters are estimated and its major assumptions are successfully tested. Fit{\~{}}een of the 18 subjects are well fitted by the model, but only 11 of them display negative bias. The second experiment tested and rejected an artifactual interpretation of the results based on Neuringer's (1986) suggestion that people can be trained to become good randomiz-ers. The third experiment extended the validity of the model by demonstrating the stability and robustness of its parameters under systematic changes in the display of previous responses. Implica-tions of the model and the data for the various theories are discussed. It is suggested that only theories which are based on the notion of a "subjective concept of randomness" are consistent with the results of these experiments. The research on subjective randomness has recently cele-brated its 50th birthday. Its beginnings can be traced to a brief observation made by Reichenbach (1934/1949) in his book on the foundations of probability theory. He speculated that people untrained in probability would be unable to generate random sequences and would produce instead series with too many al-ternations. This observation was confirmed in a variety of ex-periments reviewed by Tune (1964a, 1964b) and in a most de-tailed and systematic fashion by Wagenaar (1972a, 1972b). The experimental work in this domain has used three para-digms. In randomization experiments, subjects were instructed to produce a sequence of responses with random characteris-tics, that is, "a random sequence." Such experiments were per-formed with various numbers of alternative responses (from bi-nary series with two responses to 26 alternatives), with various lengths of sequences (from 20 to 2,520), and with a variety of stimuli (numbers, letters, symbols, etc.). Subjects responded by writing or calling out the sequence or by pushing buttons and stamping symbols at different rates of response. A detailed sum-mary of all the experimental conditions and response proce-dures was provided by Wagenaar (1972a, 1972b). In the con-strained randomization procedure the subjects are presented with all the components of the sequence (e.g., 50 blue cards and 50 yellow ones) and are required to arrange them in random},

The authors next present the general approach of the mathematical theory of complexity, which identifies the length of the shortest program for reproducing a sequence with its degree of randomness. They describe three experiments, based on mean group responses, indicating that the perceived randomness of a sequence is better predicted by various measures of its encoding difficulty than by its objective randomness. These results seem to imply that in accordance with the complexity view, judging the extent of a sequence's randomness is based on an attempt to mentally encode it.

Although algorithmic complexity has been suggested as a means for overcoming this inconvenience, it has never been used, because standard Kolmogorov complexity is inapplicable to short strings (e.g., of length l{\thinspace}≤{\thinspace}50), due to both computational and theoretical limitations.

  abstract = {Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity has long been believed to be impossible to approximate when it comes to short sequences (e.g. of length 5-50). However, with the newly developed coding theorem method the complexity of strings of length 2-11 can now be numerically estimated. We present the theoretical basis of algorithmic complexity for short strings (ACSS) and describe an R-package provid-ing functions based on ACSS that will cover psychologists' needs and improve upon previous methods in three ways: (1) ACSS is now available not only for binary strings, but for strings based on up to 9 different symbols, (2) ACSS no longer requires time-consuming computing, and (3) a new approach based on ACSS gives access to an estimation of the complexity of strings of any length. Finally, three illus-trative examples show how these tools can be applied to psychology. Randomness and complexity are two concepts which are intimately related and are both central to numerous recent developments in various fields, including finance (Taufemback et al., 2011, Brandouy et al., 2012), lin-guistics (Gruber, 2010; Naranan, 2011), neuropsychology (Machado et al., 2010; Fern{\'{a}}ndez et al., 2011, 2012), psy-chiatry (Yang and Tsai, 2012; Takahashi 2013), genetics (Yagil, 2009; Ryabko et al. 2013), sociology (Elzinga, 2010) and the behavioral sciences (Watanabe et al., 2003; Scafetta et al., 2009). In psychology, randomness and complex-ity have recently attracted interest, following the realiza-tion that they could shed light on a diversity of previ-ously undeciphered behaviors and mental processes. It has been found, for instance, that the subjective difficulty of a concept is directly related to its " boolean complexity " , defined as the shortest logical description of a concept (Feldman, 2000, 2003, 2006). In the same vein, visual detec-tion of shapes has been shown to be related to contour complexity (Wilder et al., 2011). More generally, perceptual organization itself has been described as based on simplicity or, equivalently, likelihood (Chater, 1996; Chater and Vit{\'{a}}nyi, 2003), in a model recon-ciling the complexity approach (perception is organized to minimize complexity) and a probability approach (percep-tion is organized to maximize likelihood), very much in line with our view in this paper. Even the perception of similarity may be viewed through the lens of (conditional) complexity (Hahn et al., 2003). Randomness and complexity also play an important role in modern approaches to selecting the " best " among a set of candidate models (i.e., model selection; e.g., Myung et},

They also draw upon our approximate sense of complexity. A detrimental effect of aging on pseudo-random productions has been demonstrated for some tasks, but little is as yet known about the developmental curve of cognitive complexity over the lifespan. We investigate the complexity trajectory across the lifespan of human responses to five common RIG tasks, using a large sample (n = 3429). Our main finding is that the developmental curve of the estimated algorithmic complexity of responses is similar to what may be expected of a measure of higher cognitive abilities, with a performance peak around 25 and a decline starting around 60, suggesting that RIG tasks yield good estimates of such cognitive abilities. Our study illustrates that very short strings of, i.e., 10 items, are sufficient to have their complexity reliably estimated and to allow the documentation of an age-dependent decline in the approximate sense of complexity.},

@article{hahn2009,
  abstract = {A long tradition of psychological research has lamented the systematic errors and biases in people's perception of the characteristics of sequences generated by a random mechanism such as a coin toss. It is proposed that once the likely nature of people's actual experience of such processes is taken into account, these " errors " and " biases " actually emerge as apt reflections of the probabilistic characteristics of sequences of random events. Specifically, seeming biases reflect the subjective experience of a finite data stream for an agent with a limited short-term memory capacity. Consequently, these biases seem testimony not to the limitations of people's intuitive statistics but rather to the extent to which the human cognitive system is finely attuned to the statistics of the environment. In a famous set of experiments, Kahneman and Tversky (1972) demonstrated that people's perceptions of randomness were sys-tematically biased. Asked to indicate, for example, which of the exact orders of outcomes from the toss of an unbiased coin is more likely, HTHHTT or HHHHHH (where H ϭ heads and T ϭ tails), people reliably choose the former. However, as the statistician knows, both orders are equally likely to occur when tossing a coin six times. Laypeople, it seems, erroneously expect that the essen-tial characteristics of the generating process will be represented, " not only globally in the entire sequence, but also locally in each of its parts " (Kahneman {\&} Tversky, 1972, p. 435). A random generating process such as tossing an unbiased coin will lead to global, long-run sequences that contain equal numbers of heads and tails. Our lay intuition is that this property is reflected in short sequences also. Decades of research have established three inter-related aspects of people's misperceptions of randomness: 1. People think a sequence is more likely, and hence ran-dom, if there is some irregularity in order of appearance (e.g., HHTHTH vs. HTHTHT).},

The implications of that constraint are explored by analysing the sampling distribution of the most common measure of relationship - the product moment correlation (Peasrons's r). This distribution is skewed when the populations correlations differs from zero (i.e., when correlation exists), and the more so, the smaller the sample. As both the population value, it follows that samples likely to be encountered indicate a correlation stronger than that in the population. thus, the limited capacity of working memory may serve as an amplifier that helps people to avoid missing strong relationships. As the distribution is more skewed the smaller the sample size, the effect suggests an explanation for the fact that young children detect meaningful covariation fairly rapidly.},

The domains of judgment include random devices, births, lotteries, sports performances, stock prices, and others. After discussing existing theories of sequence judgments, the authors conclude that in many everyday settings people have naive complex models of the mechanisms they believe generate observed events, and they rely on these models for explanations, predictions, and other inferences about event sequences. The authors next introduce an explanation-based, mental models framework for describing people's beliefs about binary sequences, based on 4 perceived characteristics of the sequence generator: randomness, intentionality, control, and goal complexity. Furthermore, they propose a Markov process framework as a useful theoretical notation for the description of mental models and for the analysis of actual event sequences.},

The most prevalent variety, random number generation, involves several limitations, however. In the original Mittenecker Pointing Test (MPT; Mittenecker, 1958), subjects were instructed to point successively and as randomly as possible at nine unlabeled circles irregularly arranged on a cardboard. With the computer program presented here, Mittenecker's classical test has been transferred to a contemporary format. The MPT can be applied using a standard PC keyboard and computes a series of sophisticated measures of deviations from randomness on the basis of information theory analysis. Because of its easy and well-controlled administration and reduced demands on memory and attention, the automatized MPT offers a wide range of application possibilities in normal but also in severely impaired clinical samples.",

abstract = "Working memory capacity is traditionally treated as a unitary construct that can be explained using one cognitive mechanism (e.g., storage, attention control). Several recent studies have, however, demonstrated that multiple mechanisms are needed to explain individual differences in working memory capacity. The present study focuses on three such mechanisms: Maintenance/disengagement in primary memory, retrieval from secondary memory, and attention control. Structural equation modeling reveals that each of these mechanisms is important to explaining individual differences in working memory capacity. Further analyses reveal that the degree to which these mechanisms are apparent may be driven by the type of task used to operationalize working memory capacity. Specifically, complex span (processing and storage) and visual arrays (change detection) performance is strongly related to a person’s attention control, while running memory span (memory for last n items on a list) performance has a relationship to primary memory that is apparent above-and-beyond other working memory tasks. Finally, regardless of the working memory task that is used, it is found that primary and secondary memory fully explain the relationship of working memory capacity to general fluid intelligence."

    abstract = { Working memory capacity and fluid intelligence have been demonstrated to be strongly correlated traits. Typically, high working memory capacity is believed to facilitate reasoning through accurate maintenance of relevant information. In this article, we present a proposal reframing this issue, such that tests of working memory capacity and fluid intelligence are seen as measuring complementary processes that facilitate complex cognition. Respectively, these are the ability to maintain access to critical information and the ability to disengage from or block outdated information. In the realm of problem solving, high working memory capacity allows a person to represent and maintain a problem accurately and stably, so that hypothesis testing can be conducted. However, as hypotheses are disproven or become untenable, disengaging from outdated problem solving attempts becomes important so that new hypotheses can be generated and tested. From this perspective, the strong correlation between working memory capacity and fluid intelligence is due not to one ability having a causal influence on the other but to separate attention-demanding mental functions that can be contrary to one another but are organized around top-down processing goals. }

@phdthesis{setareh2016,
  abstract = {Randomness is one of the most important research areas in computer science and in particular, in cryptography. Security of almost all cryptosystems relies on random keys. Unfortunately, perfect sources of randomness are not easily accessible. However, True Random Number Generators (TRNGs) generate almost random strings, using non-perfect random sequences. A TRNG algorithm consists of an entropy source and an extractor. In this thesis, a TRNG is proposed in which a human player's input in a two-player game is used as the entropy source and the random seed required by the extractor. This means that the proposed TRNG is only dependent on user's inputs. The thesis contains the theoretical foundation of the approach, the design, and implementation of the corresponding game. To validate theories, we designed and implemented a game, and performed some user studies. The results of our exper- iments support the effectiveness of the proposed method in generating high-quality randomness. ii},

Research on retrieval-induced forgetting has shown that retrieval of one item in memory can cause the forgetting of other items in memory. This forgetting is argued to be the consequence of an inhibitory process that underlies the ability to overcome interference during retrieval. The research reviewed here suggests that individuals who exhibit more retrieval-induced forgetting are more capable of overcoming interference in other contexts as well (e.g., creative problem solving). Ironically, it appears that thinking and remembering rely at least in part on a process that underlies forgetting. }

@article{warren2018,
  abstract = {Human randomness perception is commonly described as biased. This is because when generating random sequences humans tend to systematically under-and overrepresent certain subsequences relative to the number expected from an unbiased random process. In a purely theoretical analysis we have previously suggested that common misperceptions of randomness may actually reflect genuine aspects of the statistical environment, once cognitive constraints are taken into account which impact on how that environment is actually experienced (Hahn {\&} Warren, Psychological Review, 2009). In the present study we undertake an empirical test of this account, comparing human-generated against unbiased process-generated binary sequences in two experiments. We suggest that comparing human and theoretically unbiased sequences using metrics reflecting the constraints imposed on human experience provides a more meaningful picture of lay people's ability to perceive randomness. Finally, we propose a simple generative model of human random sequence generation inspired by the Hahn and Warren account. Taken together our results question the notion of bias in human randomness perception. Public Significance Statement The dominant perspective in experimental psychology is that human judgment and decision making are flawed. This is particularly evident in research on human perception of randomness. Here we explore this idea, presenting several analyses of data from an experiment in which participants are asked to generate a sequence of outcomes from a binary random process (like a coin toss). Although behavior does depart from the output of genuinely random source, the extent of this departure depends on how performance is characterized and whether constraints on human memory and attention span are taken into account. We find that when such constraints are considered, and appropriate performance measures are used, humans actually match the random source rather well. We argue more generally it may be problematic to emphasize errors in human judgment and decision-making without taking account of appropriate constraints.},

abstract = {Randomness is a necessary ingredient in various computational tasks and especially in Cryptography, yet many existing mechanisms for obtaining randomness suffer from numerous problems. We suggest utilizing the behavior of humans while playing competitive games as an entropy source, in order to enhance the quality of the randomness in the system. This idea has two motivations: (i) results in experimental psychology indicate that humans are able to behave quite randomly when engaged in competitive games in which a mixed strategy is optimal, and (ii) people have an affection for games, and this leads to longer play yielding more entropy overall. While the resulting strings are not perfectly random, we show how to integrate such a game into a robust pseudo-random generator that enjoys backward and forward security. We construct a game suitable for randomness extraction, and test users playing patterns. The results show that in less than two minutes a human can generate 128 bits that are 2-64-close to random, even on a limited computer such as a PDA that might have no other entropy source. As proof of concept, we supply a complete working software for a robust PRG. It generates random sequences based solely on human game play, and thus does not depend on the Operating System or any external factor.},
